# BoomerangJS App Utils

Utils to simplify distributed application development.

## PI Example

The example folder contains a simple application to calculate PI using Machin's formula.

The stages from a synchronous command line version to the distributed BommerangJS version are documented:

* synchronous version `pi_sync.js`
* asynchronous/Promise version `pi_async.js`
* distributed version `pi.js` and `arctan.js`
